### Web Components, Shadow DOM, CSS Variables. Understanding the new components architecture in Ionic.
In our previous post [Ionic 4 vs Ionic 3 — What you need to know about Ionic 4](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/ionic-4-vs-ionic-3) we surfaced the main differences between Ionic 3 and Ionic 4. 

Ionic 4 introduced a lot of changes that you need understand because they changed the way Ionic Framework components work. 

Then, when Ionic 5 was released, we created the post [What's new in Ionic 5 - Migration and Free Starter](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/ionic5-tutorial-migration-and-starter) where we explain how to take advantage of the new benefits from Ionic 5.

In this series of posts we are going to go deeper on the structure and core concepts of Ionic apps and explore more advanced topics, so if you are new to Ionic, I strongly recommend that you first read our [Introduction to Ionic tutorial](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/ionic-framework-introduction-and-key-components).

Covering everything from styling and customizing Ionic components, to building custom web components with Stencil and then use them in your Ionic projects (or any other framework, as web components are framework agnostic!).
